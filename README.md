# exoskeleton
i want to make an exoskeleton for legs assist and arms strength
i will be using pneumatic cylinders for arms, and linear actuators for legs.

the arm design is kinda based on hacksmiths exoskeleton. i will be using AKARI Bore 50 mm x Stroke 125 mm SC Series Double Acting Non Magnetic Cylinder for the arms, and 12v 125mm linear actuator for the legs. the arms will be able to lift about 60kgs, the linear actuators will be of 1500N = ~10kg.

- as said before, using pneumatic cylinders. it will be a welded frame (smaw prob), with straps attached (kinda like hacksmiths). it will be abt to lift 60kgs theoretically. the arms will be attached to a big screw, using the hacksmith design thingey again.

- the pneumatic cylinders will be attached like this. btw i couldnt find an accurate model of the thing im going to order so this instead.

- will be using a 5/2 12v solenoid valve to control this
