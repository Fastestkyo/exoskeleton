# exoskeleton
i want to make an exoskeleton for legs assist and arms strength. ive always wanted to build an exoskeleton cuz they look so cool.
i will be using pneumatic cylinders for arms, and linear actuators for legs.

the arm design is kinda based on hacksmiths exoskeleton. i will be using AKARI Bore 50 mm x Stroke 125 mm SC Series Double Acting Non Magnetic Cylinder for the arms, and 12v 125mm linear actuator for the legs. the arms will be able to lift about 60kgs, the linear actuators will be of 1500N = ~10kg.

- as said before, using pneumatic cylinders. it will be a welded frame (smaw), with straps attached (kinda like hacksmiths). it will be abt to lift 60kgs theoretically. the arms will be attached to a big screw, using the hacksmith design thingey again. im using pneumatic cylinders because they are strong, and fast.

- the pneumatic cylinders will be attached like this. btw i couldnt find an accurate model of the thing im going to order so this instead.

- will be using a 5/2 12v solenoid valve to control this

- using linear actuator 12v, 125mm stroke. this is ideal for legs cuz leg movements are slow, ie walking up the stairs. this will assist ppl. using arduino for this. also using a IBT-2 (BTS7960) Dual H-Bridge Driver for this.

- the legs are make up of 3 joints-

- the actuators are mounted like this-

i have prior welding expirience as i welded my 3d printer frame
