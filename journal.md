## Day 2: June 3rd:
-did some research on the mechanics of the arms. using pneumatic cylinders for arms, which is for more strength. and using linear actuator for legs, which is for support. then the sensors will detect muscle activites and the actuators and stuff will move accordingly. sensor for this is emg, flex( elbow_), force sensor and gyro.

## Day 3: June 4th:
- started with cad. im using 125mm stroke, 25mm bore pneumatic cylinders. the red thing is arms
